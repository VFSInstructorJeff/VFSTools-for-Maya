How to use the custom layer editor

1. Creating a layer with a mesh selected will create a copy of the mesh to be used as collision.
2. Control the visibility of the entire layer, static meshes only or collision meshes only to help yourself on your work flow.
3. Keep the naming convention SM\_**, UCX\_SM\_** and \*\*\_grp naming convention in the outliner
4. Use the custom layer editor not the outliner to rename the layer as desired
5. Be carefull to have all meshes with unique names
